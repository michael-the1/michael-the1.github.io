Welcome to my humble corner on the internet :) Here's a bit about me.

As a pacticing *Christian*, I try to share and live by the Good News that Jesus brought.
At the [Maranatha Kerk Vlaardingen](https://www.maranatha-kerk-vlaardingen.nl/), I'm a youth pastor where I pastor and educate a small group of teenagers (ages 12-18).

I graduated with an *Msc. Computer Science* from the Delft University of Technology.
My thesis was on measuring progress in music rehearsals.
It was a difficult, largely unexplored, and perhaps slightly too ambitious topic.
And it was a lot of fun.

Currently, I'm working as a *Data Science consultant* at Accenture, bringing out the predictive value out of the data that organizations collect.
What I love about my job is the diversity of my tasks.
I get to dive deep into the math behind a model, engineer a data pipeline that can efficiently process large datasets, and design user-friendly interfaces.
At the same time, I lead projects in the right direction, mentor and guide my colleagues, and learn from the best.
I get to combine both the technical and the business.

Some more fun stuff:

- I was born and raised in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, the greatest city in the world
- Love: cooking, piano & guitar, bouldering, photography, reading
- I can hold a conversation in Japanese. こんにちは!
