title: ðŸ¥œ Data Science in a nutshell
---
Data Science is a buzzword.
Different people mean different things when they say Data Science.
But here's how I explain it to an audience that's not familiar with the field:

> If it's too big or complicated for Excel, it's Data Science.

Most people have worked with Excel at some point in their lives.
Excel only goes up to around 1 million rows.
So if, for example, your data consists of the population of The Netherlands (~17 million), you need something more powerful: you need Data Science.
Another example would be image recognition.
Face recognition is now available in most phones.
But an average picture has over a million pixels.
And let's not even get started on how to calculate with pixels in Excel.
It's just not the tool for the job.

Obviously, this explanation of "too big or complicated for Excel" is not very accurate and not very nuanced.
But it gets people thinking in the right direction, and that's good enough for a conversation.
