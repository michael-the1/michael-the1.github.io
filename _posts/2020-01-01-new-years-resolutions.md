2019 was a pretty hectic year for me and I'm ready to begin 2020 with renewed vigor.
Research points out that New Year's resolutions tend to fail, and I'm not going to hold myself hostage to these statements, but I hope to motivate myself a bit more by making them public.

1. **Less social media, more books**
Over the years, I've started reading more and more and, in 2019, I read about 6 books.
I'm pretty happy with my reading pace (one book every two months sounds about right), but I'd like to trade in more social media time (instagram, reddit, and twitter) with reading time.
I also finally caved and bought an e-reader and that has helped a lot.
My [reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96071253-michael) consists roughly of 1. christian books, 2. business books, and 3. fiction.
The first two already have a decently narrow scope.
For fiction, I started reading fantasy and I'd like to make a start on the Wheel of Time series.

2. **1/4 marathon (10.55km) in under an hour**
On April 5, I'll be running the [1/4 marathon in Rotterdam](https://www.nnmarathonrotterdam.nl/).
This is the third time I'll be participating, but I've never been able to go under an hour.
Mostly because I'm very lazy.
But, as they say, third time's the charm.

3. **8 pull-ups by July 1**
I'm currently capable of 5 pull-ups.
8 seems like a low target, and that's on purpose, since I mostly want to focus on the run first until April.
I figured it's better to have a low target by a date that comes up relatively quickly, than a target that's too high (I have too much experience with that already).

4. **Lead at work**
Last year, I started my first full-time job at Accenture as a Data Science consultant.
I feel very blessed with my job.
I have inspiring colleagues and interesting and challenging work.
I get to do both the nerdy Data Science and lead and steer projects.
Having finally settled in, it's time for me to take up more initiative and set the tone in our team.

5. **Streamline at church**
I believe 2020 will be a turning point for [our church](https://www.maranatha-kerk-vlaardingen.nl/).
For me personally, it's time to give more focus to less things.
It's going to be tough to choose, but for now, will probably be the right decision.
