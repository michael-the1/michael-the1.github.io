In light of the coronavirus (COVID-19), many people are working from home, some even for the first time.
Here are 5 habits that help me work from home.
They're designed to get me into work when I need to and disengage from work when it's over.

*Disclaimer: I currently live by myself.
No kids, no partner, no roommate.

## 1. Get dressed for work ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Working from home sounds like a great excuse to work in your pajamas.
So warm, so comfortable!
But I've noticed that getting dressed puts me in working mode.
Just like how Superman only becomes Superman when he puts on his cape.
So, even when working from home, get dressed for work.

## 2. Take a walk - and plan them in üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

At the office, meetings are usually a great excuse to stand or walk around a bit.
At home, you'll probably be working behind your computer all day.
You also probably know that you need to take regular breaks from your computer.
I say: plan them in.
I'm planning to take a walk at lunchtime (12:00) and after work (18:00 at the latest).

Extra bonus tip from a colleague: do some exercise at the end of the day to disengage from work.

## 3. Designate a space ü™ë

If you have the luxury, designate a room or a space to work.
That way, when you're at the space, you'll be working.
When you're not, it's easier to stop thinking about work.
For me, I have a desk in my living room.
Although it's not a perfectly separated space, what helps is that when I'm not sitting on my office chair, I'm simply not working.
So in my case, it'd be more accurate to say that my designated working space is my office chair.

## 4. Think of your posture ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As you'll be sitting behind your desk for longer periods of time, it's important to think of your posture.
Sitting in a single position for hours is going to be detrimental for your health and productivity.
It's not really important how you sit, it's important that you vary it up every so often.
A few years ago, I set a timer that reminded me every 15 minutes to change my posture.
Annoying, yes, but after a few days it already became a habit.

Here's a video with some tips for stretches that help your posture that you can do at home:

## 5. Use video calls üìπ

It's tempting to do everything by chat or email, but hearing voices and seeing faces can make a big difference in communication.
Seeing each other's faces helps with empathy.
After all, a large part of communication is non-verbal.

Loneliness can also be a real issue.
As I mentioned in the disclaimer, I live by myself.
If I don't plan anything in, I can go days without interacting with someone.
Video calls can actually make a big difference here. 
So, if you have a webcam, use it!
